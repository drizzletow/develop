# 一 Spring Security





























<br>



# 二 Apache Shiro

Shiro官方文档：https://shiro.apache.org/

Shiro provides the application security API to perform the following aspects ( I like to call these the 4 cornerstones of application security):

- Authentication - proving user identity, often called user ‘login’.
- Authorization - access control
- Cryptography - protecting or hiding data from prying eyes
- Session Management - per-user time-sensitive state

Shiro also supports some auxiliary features, such as web application security, unit testing, and multithreading support, but these exist to reinforce the above four primary concerns.



```bash

术语解释：

1. Subject ：User
   Almost everything you do in Shiro is based on the currently executing user, called a Subject.
   
2.Realms ：pluggable data access objects (DAOs)
  you can create your own realms to support specific functionality.

```
